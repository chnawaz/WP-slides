    <h1>WHAT THIS BOOK COVERS</h1>
    <p>You’ll begin by looking at exactly what JavaScript is, and taking your first steps with the
    underlying language and syntax. You’ll learn all the fundamental programming concepts,
    including <b>data</b> and <b>data types</b>, and structuring your code to make <b>decisions</b> in your
    programs or to <b>loop</b> over the same piece of code many times. </p>
    <p>Once you’re comfortable with the basics, you’ll move on to one of the key ideas in
    JavaScript—the <b>object</b>. You’ll learn how to take advantage of the objects that are native to
    the JavaScript language, such as <b>functions</b>, <b>dates</b>, and <b>strings</b>, and find out how these
    objects enable you to manage complex data and simplify your programs. Next, you’ll see
    how you can use JavaScript to manipulate and detect objects made available to you in the
    browser and detect the browsers. </p>
    <p>From here, you’ll move on to more <u>advanced topics</u>, <i>such as</i> writing code to <mark >dynamically
    manipulate elements</mark> within a web page and <mark>executing code when certain things happen</mark>
    within your page. You’ll also learn how to script <b>forms</b> and other <b>controls</b>. Using this
    knowledge, you can start to create truly professional-looking applications that enable you
    to interact with the user. </p>
    <p>You’ll then learn how to <mark>store data</mark> within the browser and <mark>communicate directly with a
    server</mark>. You’ll also learn how to write code for the new HTML5 media elements, and write
    your own custom user interface for them. </p>
    <p>You’ll explore some of the time saving <u>JavaScript frameworks</u> <i>such as</i> <b>jQuery</b>, <b>Modernizr</b>,
    <b>Prototype</b>, <i>and</i> <b>MooTools</b> and see <mark>how they work and how they can help you create
    sophisticated JavaScript powered applications</mark>. </p>
    <p>Finally, you’ll look at common <u>syntax</u> and <u>logical errors</u>, how you can <mark style="background-color: #0096FF;">spot them, and how
    to use</mark> the <u>JavaScript debuggers</u> for <b>Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari,</b> <i>and</i> <b>Opera</b>
    to aid you with this task. Also, you need to examine how to handle the errors that slip
    through the net, and ensure that these do not detract from the experience of the end user of
    your application. </p>
